## Michael 'Air' Jordan

**Michael Jeffrey Jordan** was born in Brooklyn, New York, on February 17, 1963. He was one of five children born to James and Deloris Jordan. During elementary school, he was primarily interested in baseball and soccer. Over time, influenced by his older brother, he also started playing basketball.

![](pictures/wings1.jpg){fig-alt="MIcheal Jordan - wings" fig-align="center"}

Jordan's NBA career began in 1984. He quickly became a league star, playing for the **Chicago Bulls** as a shooting guard wearing jersey number **23**. Over the years, he achieved numerous successes, setting many records, some of which remain unbeaten to this day. He was included in the list of the 50 greatest players in NBA history and is widely regarded by many as the **Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T)**.

More information about the biography of Michael Jordan - @MJ.

MJ participated in the NBA All-Star Game 14 times, won 5 MVP awards, was a two-time Olympic champion, and won the NBA championship 6 times. Jordan's final season with the Chicago Bulls was extraordinary - it was overshadowed by tensions with the club's management and the overwhelming sense that it was truly the last opportunity to see the greatest basketball player of all time in full glory. The then coach, Phil Jackson, called this season **"The Last Dance"**. Using information from websites such as [www.basketball-reference.com](http://www.basketball-reference.com) and [www.landofbasketball.com](http://www.landofbasketball.com), I will analyze Michael Jordan's statistics in the 1997-98 season.

# Regular season

**The 1997-98 season marked the 52nd season of the NBA**, featuring 29 teams that collectively played **82 games** each. The season commenced on October 31, 1997, and concluded on April 19, 1998. @97/98

## Time

Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls attracted millions of viewers to the arena and in front of their televisions during each of the 82 games in the 1997-98 season. "His Airness" spent an average of **38.88** minutes on the court, totaling **3188** minutes throughout the season.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-MinSummary
#| tbl-cap: Summary of minutes played on the court
RS %>% 
  summarise("Minimum time"=min(MIN),
            "Average time"=round(mean(MIN), digits=2),
            "Sum"=sum(MIN),
            "Maksimum time"=max(MIN)) %>% 
   kbl(align = "c") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options=c("striped", "hover","condensed","bordered"), full_width = F, position = "center")
```

The highest amount of minutes spent on the court was as much as **50**, and it occurred on November 21, 1997 - it required overtime. Meanwhile, the lowest record was **24** minutes. Both of these games ended with victories.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-MinMaxMinutes
#| tbl-cap: Games with the highest and lowest number of minutes played
RS %>% 
  arrange(-MIN) %>% 
  filter(row_number()==1 | row_number()== n()) %>% 
  select(c(1,2,3,4)) %>%
    mutate(MIN=color_bar("red")(MIN)) %>% 
  rename( "Result of the game"="WL",
          "Minutes played"="MIN") %>%
  kbl(align = "c",escape=F) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options=c("striped", "hover","condensed","bordered"), full_width = F, position = "center") %>%

  column_spec(4, 
              color ="white",bold=T)
```

Below (Refer to [Fig. - @fig-MintoDate]) is a line chart showing the number of minutes spent on the court during the games played throughout the entire season.

```{r,fig.width=16,fig.height=7}

        legend.text = element_text(size = 20),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 20))
  
```

## Points

Jordan was known for his scoring ability. His average points scored in the 97-98 season were **28.74**, with a total sum of **2357.**

```{r}
#| label: tbl-PtsSummary
#| tbl-cap: Summary of points scored
RS %>% 
  summarise("Min"=min(PTS),
            "Mean"=round(mean(PTS), digits=2),
            "Sum"=sum(PTS),
            "Max"=max(PTS)) %>% 
   kbl(align = "c") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options=c("striped", "hover","condensed","bordered"), full_width = F, position = "center")
```

During each of the 82 games, Michael scored a double-digit number of points (Refer to [Tbl. - @tbl-PtsSummary]). However, the number of games in which his scoring was higher than 25 was significantly greater than the number of games in which he did not score 25 points (Refer to [Fig. - @fig-Morethan25]). The exact total of these games is **58**.

```{r}
x <- RS %>% 
  filter(PTS>25) %>% 
  summarise("MoreT25"=n())
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-Morethan25
#| fig-cap: Number of games in which MJ scored more than 25 points
RS %>% 
  group_by(WL,PTS>25) %>% 
  summarise("MoreT25"=n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(WL, MoreT25, fill=factor(`PTS > 25`))) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge", colour = "white")+
  labs(y="Number of games",
       x="Result of the game \n\n L - Loss    W - Win  ",
       fill="Scoring more than 25 points")+
    scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("#CE1141", "#000000"),
    labels=c("No","Yes"))+
  geom_text(aes(label=MoreT25),
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
            vjust = -0.3)
```

```{r}
TypesofPTS <- RS %>% 
  summarise("OnePTS"=sum(FT),
            "TwoPTS"=(sum(PTS)-sum(FT)-(sum(TP)*3)),
            "ThreePTS"=(sum(TP)*3))
            
TypesofPTS_df <- data.frame(
  group=c("Points scored from free throws","Points scored from midrange","Points scored from beyond the 3-point line"),
  value=c(TypesofPTS$OnePTS,TypesofPTS$TwoPTS,TypesofPTS$ThreePTS)
)
```

The Golden Era of the NBA was characterized by physicality and fewer three-point attempts, which is also evident in Jordan's style of play. **The majority of his points were scored with mid-range jump shots**, which are worth two points each (Refer to [Fig. - @fig-TypeofPTS]).

```{r}
#| label: fig-TypeofPTS
#| fig-cap: Total points scored from free throws, mid-range, and beyond the 7.24m line
ggplot(TypesofPTS_df, aes(x="", y=value, fill=group)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1.5, color="black") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  theme_void()+
  labs(fill="")+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#FFFFFF","#000000","#CE1141"))+
  geom_text(aes(label = value),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
            color=ifelse(TypesofPTS_df$value==90,"black","white"))
```

```{r}
Per_Osobiste <- RS %>% 
  summarise("Made"=percent(sum(FT)/sum(FTA)),
            "Missed"=percent(1-(sum(FT)/sum(FTA))))

Per_Osobiste_df <- data.frame(
  group=c("Made","Missed"),
  value=c(Per_Osobiste$Made,Per_Osobiste$Missed)
)
```

```{r}
MeanofFT <- RS %>% 
  summarise("Średnia rzutóW osobistych na mecz"=round(sum(FTA)/82,digits = 2)) 
  
```

Due to frequent fouls against MJ aimed at preventing him from scoring and discouraging further play, he often found himself at the free-throw line, averaging 9 attempts per game. However, he executed these shots with excellent accuracy, shooting at 78% (Refer to [Fig. - @fig-PercentFT]), which allowed him to score as many as **565 points** (Refer to [Fig. - @fig-TypeofPTS]) in the 1997-98.

```{r}
#| label: fig-PercentFT
#| fig-cap: Free throw shooting accuracy
ggplot(Per_Osobiste_df, aes(x="", y=value, fill=group)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1, color="white") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  theme_void()+
  labs(fill="")+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#CE1141","#000000"))+
  geom_text(aes(label = value),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
            color="white")
```

We know that MJ's average minutes per game was **38.88** (Refer to [Tbl. - @tbl-MinSummary]), while the average points scored were **28.74**. (Refer to. [Tbl. - @tbl-PtsSummary]). From the graph below, (Refer to [Fig. - @fig-MinToPoints]) we can observe how the minutes played on the court influence the scoring output.

```{r}
#| label: fig-MinToPoints
#| fig-cap: The relationship between minutes and points scored

RS %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x=MIN,y=PTS,group=1))+
    geom_point(shape=21, size=4,aes(fill=after_stat(y>28.74)))+
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method="lm", color=alpha("black",0.5), size=1.5)+
  labs(y="Minutes on the court",
       x="Number of points scored",
       fill="Number of points scored above the average (28.74)")+
    scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("#CE1141", "#FFFFFF"),
    labels = c("No","Yes")
  )+
  theme(legend.position = "top")

```

*„I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed*.*" - **Michael Jordan** - @cytatMJ*

```{r}

```

In the 1997-98 season, MJ attempted a total of **1893** shots, of which he made **881**. The graph below (Refer to [Fig. - @fig-FGtoFGA]) illustrates the difference between successful and unsuccessful shots increasing from game to game.

```{r,,fig.width=16,fig.height=7}

```

Let's take a look at how MJ performed against individual teams. The Chicago Bulls faced 29 teams during the 1997-98 season, with the smallest number of games against a team being **2** and the largest being **4**. (Refer to. [Tbl. - @tbl-MeczeSummary]).

```{r}

```

```{r}

## Assists, steals, blocks and rebounds

MJ was excellent in offense, but he was also outstanding in defense - he was a "**two-way player**". To summarizes his assists, steals, blocks, and rebounds. Meanwhile, the plot (Refer to [Fig. - @fig-StealsandBlocks]) illustrates the increasing sum of steals and blocks from game to game.

Shooting guard - the position where MJ played - is characterized, as the name suggests, by scoring points, but he also occasionally assisted.

**His average assists in the 97-98 season were 3.45 per game**. The graph (Refer to [Fig. - @fig-ASTtoTO]) shows the number of games comparing the number of assists and turnovers; we can see that only in **16 out of 82 games, the number of turnovers exceeded assists**.

MJ, as the captain of the team and a superstar of the NBA, consistently gave his all in every game and fought for victory. He carried significant responsibilities towards both the fans and his teammates, which came with immense pressure. In 62 out of 82 games, **Jordan's plus/minus (+/-) rating was positive, and in 10 games, it exceeded 20, showcasing his ability to positively impact the team's performance on the court.**
